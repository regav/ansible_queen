# Welcome to my personal journey of Ansible at home

### Goals
- Create a basic vm enviornment with it's own network
- Test new software
- Practice Ansible's best practices
- Push myself to learn automation

### Ansible Roles and Tasks
- Have created a basic kvm role that works against rhel family os (NOT TESTED)
this role uses the basic structure of tasks, templates, defaults. If one wants
to use this role with their own machine/hosts then one can palce their vars
within a playbook
